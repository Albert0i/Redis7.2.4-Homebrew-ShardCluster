        Return information about the cluster.
    KEYSLOT <key>
        Return the hash slot for <key>.
    MYID
        Return the node id.
    MYSHARDID

    NODES
        Return cluster configuration seen by node. Output format:
        <id> <ip:port@bus-port[,hostname]> <flags> <master> <pings> <pongs> <epoch> <link> <slot> ...
    REPLICAS <node-id>
        Return <node-id> replicas.
    SLOTS
        Return information about slots range mappings. Each range is made of:
        start, end, master and replicas IP addresses, ports and ids
    SHARDS
        Return information about slot range mappings and the nodes associated with them.
    ADDSLOTS <slot> [<slot> ...]

    BUMPEPOCH
        Advance the cluster config epoch.
    COUNT-FAILURE-REPORTS <node-id>
        Return number of failure reports for <node-id>.
    DELSLOTS <slot> [<slot> ...]
        Delete slots information from current node.
    DELSLOTSRANGE <start slot> <end slot> [<start slot> <end slot> ...]
        Delete slots information which are between <start-slot> and <end-slot> from current node.
    FAILOVER [FORCE|TAKEOVER]
        Promote current replica node to being a master.
    FORGET <node-id>
        Remove a node from the cluster.
    FLUSHSLOTS

    SETSLOT <slot> (IMPORTING <node-id>|MIGRATING <node-id>|STABLE|NODE <node-i     Set slot state.
    SAVECONFIG
        Force saving cluster configuration on disk.
    LINKS
        Return information about all network links between this node and its peers.
        Output format is an array where each array element is a map containing attributes of a link
